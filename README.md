### **Analyzing Internet Usage Trends Across Age Groups**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes internet usage trends across different age groups using publicly available data. The dataset contains demographic information categorized by age and gender, allowing us to explore how internet usage has evolved over time. The goal is to identify key patterns that can inform digital accessibility strategies and policy-making. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and trend identification to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

⚙️ **Methods Used**

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring raw data to ensure consistency and usability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating summary statistics and identifying trends in internet usage.

Data Visualization: Creating bar charts and line graphs using Matplotlib to represent trends clearly.

🛠 **Technologies**

Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy

🚀 **Getting Started**

Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/battal20/internet-usage-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   cd Internet-Usage-Analysis

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook data_science_term_project.ipynb

🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Future work could expand the dataset by incorporating external sources to compare internet usage trends across different geographic regions or socioeconomic groups. Implementing machine learning models could enhance the ability to predict future internet adoption trends based on historical data. Another improvement would be the development of an interactive dashboard, allowing users to dynamically explore the dataset and gain insights through user-friendly visualizations.
